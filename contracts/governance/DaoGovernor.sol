/* 
`DaoGovernor` is designed to require minimal Use of Storage for more Gas-efficient Operations
`Governor` is the core Contract that contains all the Logic and Primitives - It is abstract and requires choosing one of each of the Modules
`GovernorSettings` manages Settings Voting Delay, Voting Period Duration and Proposal Threshold in a way that can be updated through a Governance Proposal, without requiring an Upgrade
`GovernorCountingSimple` offers three Options to Voters: For, Against, and Abstain, and where only For and Abstain Votes are counted towards Quorum
`GovernorVotes` hooks to an ERC20Votes Instance `IVotes` to determine the Voting Power of an Account based on the Token Balance they hold when a Proposal becomes active
`GovernorVotesQuorumFraction` works together with `ERC20Votes` to define Quorum as a Percentage of the Total Supply at the Block a Proposalâ€™s Voting Power is retrieved
`GovernorTimelockControl` connects with an Instance of TimelockController - it allows multiple Proposers and Executors, in addition to the Governor itself
